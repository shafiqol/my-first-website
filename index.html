    <div class="go">Here's a short winter story for<br>

        > The snow was falling gently outside, blanketing the world in a soft white glow. Inside, the fire was crackling merrily, casting a warm light on the room. The family was gathered around the hearth, sipping hot cocoa and chatting about their day. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The father got up to answer it, and found a shivering stray dog on the doorstep. He brought the dog inside and gave him a warm blanket to curl up in. The family spent the rest of the evening playing with the dog and giving him treats. When it was time for bed, they made a cozy bed for the dog by the fire. The next morning, the dog was gone, but the family knew that he had found a warm place to sleep on a cold winter's night. <br>
